# Hotel Booking Analysis 
The objective of this repository is to analyze hotel booking data using Python to identify the factors that influence the cancellation of hotel bookings. Through data analysis and visualization techniques, the repository aims to uncover patterns and trends that can help understand why some bookings get canceled while others do not. By examining various features such as booking dates, customer information, hotel amenities, and more. The analysis can be helpful for hotel management to optimize their booking policies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Research Question
1.  What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations ?
2.  How can we make hotel reservation cancellations better ?
3.  How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions ? 

## Hypothesis
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
3. The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.


## Suggestion

2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotel. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
3. In the month of january, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
